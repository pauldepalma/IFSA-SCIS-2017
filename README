The set of programs to do f0 extraction and data collection is broken into four
steps:

    step1MakeMatrix
    --Extracts relevant data from .its files in the LENA file system

    step2ExtractFiles
    --Extracts conversations from the wave file that defines a recording session.
      There could be many thousands of these per .wav file

    step3ExtractF0
    --For each conversation, mean f0 as extracted and saved to a one of
      eight csv files

    step4ProcessData
    --Computes mean f0 for various subgroups along with standard deviation
    --As time goes on, will compute other values as well.
    --I'm considering rewriting this in R and including other programs to do
      do data analysis.

    Utils
    --Ultimately will hold various utility programs to make life easier
    --Right now will create a dictionary representing the LENA file system.
    --You can use this dictionary to determine how far processing has gotten

Each of the steps is a python program in its own directory with its own
constant and driver files.  Execute the system, execute the drivers in steps 1, 2, 3,
and 4 in that order.  In every case wait until stepA has exited before. To
do all steps in sequence, execute the script found in step0Start.

An important directory is f0Repos.  This holds up to eight csv files for each
classes we are investigating: male-nonadjacent-hh child, etc.
